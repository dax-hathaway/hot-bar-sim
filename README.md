# hot-bar-sim
This program is designed to be a simulation of the starbucks hot bar to allow for training on the iPad before releasing new baristas to train on the physical bar. 
This is meant to create a smoother transition into working on the hot bar by giving baristas the confidence of drink preparation and core beverage mastery, and to mitigate the issue of it being difficult to train baristas during normal business hours due to the possibility and probability of there being a rush during which a new barista may not be able to keep up - which often results in either the barista being moved to a slower-paced area, or in other bar-trained baristas interfering with the training flow to facilitate the servicing of customers (which is important for the business of the store, but can prove detrimental to the training of the barista).
